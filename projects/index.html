		<h2>Status</h2>
		<p>I like to fix electronics junk. Doesn't really matter if it's test equipment to upgrade my setup or a 1980s pocket 
			computer. This page will have links to some projects I'm working on if I ever get around to uploading stuff.</p>
		<p>Currently, I'm working on refurbishing a TRS-80 PC1 that had a bad LCD.</p>
		<h2>Test Equipment</h2>
		<p>Almost all of my lab equipment is salvaged and repaired. Saved from the trash heap and patched back together by 
			yours truely. None of them have a recent calibration, and whatever old calibration they had has definitely been 
			ruined by the repair process. That means it's anyone's guess how accurate they are, don't take my measurments literally.</p>
