		<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p> That's a great question. Right now its just a place for some of my thoughts whenever I decide to 
			write them down and publish them to the entire internet.

		<p> Not sure if I'll actually use this website as a blog. Seems a little too mid 2000's to me, 
			but hey, the internet was way more interesting and fun back then. Now we just have a bunch of 
			social media that just seems to breed contempt. Maybe I can recreate a little of that magic
			here, even if it is just for me and the singular person who stumbles across this site.
