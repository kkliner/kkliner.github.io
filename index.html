		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>I'm originally from a  small gold rush town in Northern California but I moved to LA a few years ago for work. I went to
			school for electrical engineering, so website design is not my wheelhouse. I intend on using this as a platform to record
			some of my more interesting personal projects that I work on whenever I have time and maybe as a blog for some of my thoughts.
		</p>
		<h2>Inspiration</h2>
		<p>I'm started this website to learn about about website development on my free time. 
		Currently, the entire website is in raw HTML, paritally becuase I have no idea what I'm doing and partially for fun.
		It makes the website super compatible and very quick to load. Open it in an ancient version of Internet Explorer, I dare you. 
		</p>

		<p> The inspirations for the minimal design is <a href="http://txti.es/">txti</a> 
			and this <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">satirical website</a>. Both are entirely text based, and while I don't 
			plan on restricting this website to not include any photos, I do think that many modern websites could do with far fewer
			images and still get their point across.
		</p>
		<p>The URL is my amateur radio callsign, if anyone was wondering.</p>
