		<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p> That's a great question. Right now its just a place for some of my thoughts whenever I decide to 
			write them down and publish them to the entire internet.

		<h5>2/3/2023</h5>
		<p>	Day number two of actually writing something for this and keeping the dust off the website. I think 
			its been a couple of years since I initially bought the domain, I'm just glad I'm finally putting it 
			to use.
		</p>
		<p> On a completely different note, my PC has been deciding lose its video output occasionally. This has 
			been happening for about a month at this point. Initially I thought a temparature sensor on the GPU had 
			gave up	the ghost causing things to overheat. I don't think that's the problem since turning up the fans
			didn't help. I updated the drivers, pulled apart my PC to dust the GPU heatsink, and put it all back together.
			Hopefully that helps.
		</p>
		<p> On an other completely different note (last one for now I swear), I'm going to try to do yoga every day 
			this month. I'll be following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-Uzx-IzGg48K4aHGyBwtPh7Sw">this</a> 
			30 day yoga series and I'll either squeeze it in to February or let it run a few days into March.
