		<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p> That's a great question. Right now its just a place for some of my thoughts whenever I decide to 
			write them down and publish them to the entire internet. I hope you like electronics, radio, and scuba diving.

		<h5>2/5/2023</h5>
		<p>	I spent some time trying to figure out what flashlight I should
			get for scuba diving. For a while I thought the lights with focusable beams were cool until I realized
			that I have never once been in a scenario where that's mandatory. I ended up finding 
			<a href="https://tovatec.com/pages/education">this guide</a> and using 
			<a href="http://flashlights.parametrek.com/index.html">this tool</a>  to narrow down the search, and
			ultimately ended up ordering <a href="https://www.sofirnlight.com/products/sofirn-sd05b-scuba-dive-flashlight-3000-lumens-xhp50-23v-led-powerful-waterproof-light?variant=5c4d2c67-39eb-425e-b8ac-0df6497310e0">this flashlight</a> 
			which was one sale for $34.99 with free shipping. Seems like a great deal considering dive lights can 
			easilly sell for 2-5 times that. I like that this model has a rotary switch instead of a push button.
			It should be much easier to operate blind and should entirely prevent cycling through a bunch 
			of high power settings before getting to the one you actually want to use. Keeps everyone's retinas intact.
			I'm slightly skeptical about build quality and longevity, but it had good reviews on Amazon so we'll see.
